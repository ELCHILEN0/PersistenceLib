How to Contribute
==============
PersistenceLib takes pride in being open source and community driven.  However, there are guidelines that must be adhered to when making pull requests to accelerate productivity.

Code Style
--------------
When contributing changes, certain requirements should be adhered to standardize the library.  PersistenceLib uses the [Google Java Code Style](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html) for controlling the style of the project.  A code style profile for your preferred IDE can be downloaded from [here](https://code.google.com/p/google-styleguide/source/browse/trunk/).

Commit Descriptions
--------------
Always write a comment when committing something to the repository. Your comment should be brief and to the point, describing what was changed and possibly why. If you made several changes, write one line or sentence about each part. If you find yourself writing a very long list of changes, consider splitting your commit into smaller parts, as described earlier. Prefixing your comments with identifiers like Fix or Add is a good way of indicating what type of change you did. It also makes it easier to filter the content later, either visually, by a human reader, or automatically, by a program.

If you fixed a specific bug or implemented a specific change request, I also recommend to reference the bug or issue number in the commit message.

Here are some examples of good commit messages:

	Changed paragraph separation from indentation to vertical space.
    	Fix: Extra image removed.
    	Fix: CSS patched to give better results when embedded in javadoc.
    	Add: A javadoc {@link} tag in the lyx, just to show it's possible.
    	...
    	Fix: Fixed bug #1938.
    	Add: Implemented change request #39381.
