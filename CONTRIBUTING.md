How to Contribute
==============
PersistenceLib takes pride in being open source and community driven.  However, there are guidelines that must be adhered to when making pull requests to accelerate productivity.

Code Style
--------------
When contributing changes, certain requirements should be adhered to standardize the library.  PersistenceLib uses the [Google Java Code Style](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html) for controlling the style of the project.  A code style profile for your preferred IDE can be downloaded from [here](https://code.google.com/p/google-styleguide/source/browse/trunk/).
